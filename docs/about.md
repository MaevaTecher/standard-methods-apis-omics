# About the COLOSS Wiki Initiative

In the past decades, COLOSS members have joined forces multiple times to
develop and condense standard methods related to honey bees, their
pests, pathogens, and hive products. This led to the open access of four
**BEEBOOK** volumes that have been enthusiastically welcomed by honey
bee researchers worldwide. Among the chapters, the “**Standard methods
for molecular research in *Apis mellifera* **” written by Evans and
collaborators in 2013 has been a cornerstone for the standardization of
honey bee molecular studies. However, since sequencing technologies and
analyzing algorithms have made tremendous progress, many described
methods needed a refreshing update. In parallel, other *Apis* species
genomes have been sequenced, thus opening new research avenues in a
comparative framework.

## Advancing Multi-Omics Research Reproducibility

Our team has spent the last years developing and summarizing new
protocols related to the recent multi-omics field advances in a new
chapter entitled “**Standard methods and good practices in *Apis* honey
bee ‘omics research**.” At the same time, next-generation sequencing and
bioinformatics will continue to improve and change, mirroring how the
multi-omics field is rapidly evolving. As a result, we concluded that a
classical chapter would become outdated unless we adopted a modern
communication approach.

Online shared resources such as databases, codes, Wikis, and tutorials
are great ways to provide protocols in a dynamic and collaborative
framework. We propose here a set of standard protocols related to
applications of genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, epigenomics,
metabolomics, metagenomics, and microbiome analyses in *Apis* honey bees.
One advantage of this platform will be version control of methods, which
can be corrected and improved by the developing team at the suggestion
of COLOSS members or experts. This would allow readers to track major
changes related to the progress of wet lab techniques or computing
pipelines.

While initially, omics data are often created for highly specialized
scope and research questions, we noted that *Apis* honey bee research
slowly moves toward multi-omics integration. This transition will push
the boundaries of our understanding regarding honey bee biology and
evolution. However, this would require the establishment of resources to
aid communication, information sharing about tools and techniques, and
data interpretation between different teams of honey bee experts. We
hope that this chapter will lay some foundations by reviewing jargon and
tools specific to each omic field and support the communication of
innovative studies taking advantage of large and complex datasets.

The methods and tutorials described here are still part of the chapter
“Standard Methods and Good Practices in *Apis* Honey Bee ‘Omics Research”
in BEEBOOK Volume IV. If these resources are useful for you, please cite

honey bee omics research, Journal of Apicultural Research TJAR (in
press)"
