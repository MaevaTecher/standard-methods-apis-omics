### Expertise: Population genomics, quantitative genetics, livestock species, *Apis mellifera* 

As an undergraduate, Sonia studied wildlife conservation and the use of population genetics to advise on conservation strategies. In 2018 she graduated with a PhD in Animal Breeding and Genetics from the Erasmus Mundus project EGS-ABG with a double diploma from Wageningen University and AgroParisTech, where she looked into ways to mitigate the impact of selection on genetic diversity in livestock using next generation sequencing data. After completing her PhD she joined INRAE, in Toulouse, to work on the BeeStrong project. The aim was to identify genetic markers linked to resistance to *Varroa destructor* infestation in the French *Apis mellifera* population using pool sequencing experiments. She also contributed to a population genomics project to better understand and describe the genetic diversity observed in the European bee populations. Always fond of analysing new data and developing new methods, in 2023 she moved to a new postdoctoral position working on epigenetics and how it can be included in current breeding decisions in livestock species. Very much in love with honey bees, she hopes to be able to develop her own research line using new data and methods to answer challenges faced in honey bee genomics.

### Expertise: Behavior, single cell transcriptomics, neurobiology, *Apis mellifera* 

Catherine is a Research Assistant Professor of bee genomics at Central State University. As an undergraduate, her primary research interests were in the transcriptional regulation of circadian clock genes in *Xenopus* frogs. As a graduate student, her dissertation research focused on *Drosophila* neurobiology. In particular, she studied the role of serotonin in sensorimotor plasticity, and applied the diverse tools available within the *Drosophila* model system to look specifically at the neural circuitry underlying coordinated crawling behavior. After taking some time off after gaining her PhD in 2015 to teach, she joined Central State as a postdoctoral fellow, where she utilized transcriptomics, single cell transcriptomics, and epigenomics to understand honey bee grooming behavior.

### Expertise: Proteomics, bioinformatics, *Apis mellifera* and many other model systems

Leonard is a Professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at the University of British Columbia. Dr. Foster comes from a family of beekeepers and got his introduction to academic bee research while doing his Bachelor’s degree in biochemistry at Simon Fraser University, where he worked with Drs. Winston and Slessor on honey bee pheromones, particularly the components of queen mandibular pheromone. He then completed a PhD in Toronto and a postdoctoral fellowship in Denmark before starting his current position in 2005. The first independent operating grant that Dr. Foster secured was to study how bee pathogens were able to manipulate the protein machinery within bee cells. Since that time he has led three very large-scale projects that have investigated some of the molecular mechanisms behind disease resistance in bees. This effort has recently moved into trying to apply this knowledge by using this information to guide selective breeding for hygienic behavior in honey bees. He is very active in extension and frequently engages the public on various aspects of honey bee biology.

Alice is a Professor at the Polytechnic Institute of Bragança (IPB) and a researcher at the Mountain Research Centre (CIMO), Portugal. She earned a doctoral degree in entomology from Texas A&M University in the United States. She developed a keen interest in honey bees during her PhD research, while studying a fascinating feral population living in oak tree cavities. For her PhD dissertation, she examined the genetic changes in this population undergoing Africanization. Currently, her main research interests involve uncovering the processes that shape extant genetic diversity patterns in honey bee populations, with a particular focus on understanding the basis of local adaptation. She has coordinated and collaborated in over 15 national and international research projects funded by the Portuguese Science Foundation and the European Commission. These projects have dealt with a wide array of subjects, such as: (i) the genomics of *Apis mellifera* to the genetics of its predators (*Vespa velutina*) and diseases (viruses and nosemosis), and (ii) the development of SNP-based assays and ML-based software for honey bee identification, and (iii) the botanical identification of bee-collected pollen via ITS2-metabarcoding.

### Expertise: Population Genomics, Comparative genomics, Transcriptomics, *Apis mellifera*, Varroa destructor 

Maeva joined the Behavioral Plasticity Research Institute as a Postdoctoral Researcher and has been based at Texas A&M University since 2021. While her current research focuses on locust phase polyphenism, she is dedicating herself to learning how to bridge the gap between disciplines and find shared evolution in diverse arthropods to contribute to the new generation of integrative biologists. She completed a PhD in Population Genetics on insular native honey bees evolution at the University of Reunion Island (where she was born). There she learned to combine classical population genetics and demographic inferences to retrace the origins of modern populations and understand which factors shaped their evolution over time. She started using whole genome sequencing during her postdoctoral position at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology in Japan, where she focused on the most detrimental honey bee parasites: Varroa mites. Her research seeks to understand how species and populations can rapidly respond and adapt to environmental changes by generating and maintaining variability.

GenPhySE, Université de Toulouse, INRAE, INPT, INP-ENVT, 31326 Castanet Tolosan, France

### Expertise: Population and comparative genomics, QTL mapping, poultry, *Apis mellifera* 

Alain obtained his PhD in molecular biology from Orsay University (France) in 1991. His first expertise was on sequencing genes coding for human blood groups and building genetic maps for locating markers linked to monogenic diseases. He now works at INRAE in Toulouse, France, where he first worked on QTL mapping in chickens and was subsequently involved in the consortiums for the assembly of reference genomes of several poultry species. First the chicken in 2004 (Sanger sequencing) and helping with updates until 2017, then the mallard duck, Muskovy duck, quail, and guinea fowl. With the establishment of short-read parallel sequencing and long-read sequencing as new standards, population genomics at the genome scale became possible, which he did in guinea fowl and now in honey bees. His main focus is to better understand the genetic diversity and admixture in European honey bee populations and to deepen our understanding of the honey bee genome structure.
