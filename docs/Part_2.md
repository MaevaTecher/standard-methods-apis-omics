# 2. Sample management

Sample management for honey bee samples is essentially the same as described for *A. mellifera* in BEEBOOK volume II (Evans et al., 2013). In cases where samples may need to be collected and handled differently before processing (e.g., museum samples), we indicate deviations at the beginning of each protocol.
